 *
 * FreeSpace Open exposes a scripting API which can be used to interface Lua scripts with FSO, see the
 * FreeSpace wiki for information on how to integrate your scripts into your mod. This document will provide
 * some information on how the API is documented.
 *
 * The documentation is generated from the C++ source code which causes some documentation issues. If a member
 * is not part of the scripting API then that member will be marked like this:
 * @notscriptingapi
