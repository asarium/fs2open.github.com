 * @brief A class for managing uniform block buffer data
 *
 * This uses the classic triple buffer approach for managing uniform data. Users of this class can request a memory
 * range for building uniform data.
 *
 * This assumes that uniform buffers use immutable storage and that buffers that are currently in use by the GPU may not
 * be deleted. This may not be true for all cases but it will make adding a new rendering backend easier.
 *
 * @warning This should not be used directly! Use gr_get_uniform_buffer instead.
