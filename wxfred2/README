====wxFRED2 - Port of Volition's FReespace EDitor to use wxWidgets GUI libraries====
===The Golden Rule of wxFRED2===
Thou shalt not mix business logic with pleasure logic.

Otherwise known as "keep the GUI code separate from the code that actually does work." All GUI elements that need to access mission-related data must go through an API provided by wxfred2.h and wxfred2.cpp.


===Installing wxWidgets===
As of wxWidgets 2.9.4, the wxWidgets community has been publishing .dll binaries for select MS Visual Studio versions and gcc. It is recommended to use these if you are inexperienced with building .libs and .dll's from source.


==Visual Studio==
MSVC users may download the headers and binaries directly from the wxWidgets hosts:
- wxWidgets 2.9.4:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.4/binaries/
- wxWidgets 2.9.5:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.5/binaries/

Be sure to download _both_ the wxWidgets-2.9.X_Headers.7z and the appropriate wxMSW-2.9.X_vcXX_Dev.7z (some vcXX values are listed below). They should both extract to the same directory, such as "C:\code\wxwidgets-2.9.4", with the headers extracting to "/include" and the Dev .dll's extracting to "/lib". Windows users must set an environment variable named WXWIN to reference the install directory, since all our VS project files use the WXWIN variable to find our wxWidgets install location. As an added bonus, it makes switching between wxWidgets versions somewhat easier.


=vcXX Toolset Versions=
- vc80  - MSVC 2005
- vc90  - MSVC 2008
- vc100 - MSVC 2010
- vc110 - MSVC 2012
- vc120 - MSVC 2013
- vc130 - MSVC 2015

SHOULD THERE BE NO AVAILABLE BINARIES FOR YOUR MSVC VERSION, you'll have to compile from the source (see section below)

You can optionally grab the wxMSW-2.9.X_vcXX_x86_ReleaseDLL.msi and have the release versions of the .dll's installed to your System32 (or SysWOW64) directory. This will allow you to run wxfred in your FSO directory without needing to copy over the dll's. We're hoping that we can just direct our end-users to download the "default libs" and not resort to distributing our own flavor.


==Other IDE's and Compiling from Source==
All other programming environments must compile their libraries from the source. Download the source code package appropriate to your operating system (such as wxMSW for Windows, wxGTK for Linux, wxMac for Mac OS) and extract them to your code directory, such as "C:\code\wxWidgets-2.9.4". The version number is optional, but recommended since common workflow is to have a directory per wxWidgets version.

The "/build" subdirectory contains makefiles and a number of solution and project files for a number of the more popular IDE's. If you have a version of MSVS that is newer than the provided .sln files (within /build/msw)


==wxWidgets Manual==
You can refer to the wxWidgets manual online or download a copy of it for offline use. The .CHM package will give you a single file that you can click on/shortcut to (it'll open up something like a standard help file), but you can also just grab the HTML files if you're more comfortable navigating through with a browser. In either case, you can save them in your WXWIN directory in a new sub directory "/docs/htmlhelp"

You can also run doxygen on the headers and get a significant amount of the manual that way, although be advised that its example code and overviews will be limited.


===Directory Map===
"/wxfred2/base"
- contains the tool generated files which are derived by all windows, frames, and dialogs found elsewhere in "/wxfred2"
- Also includes an XML resource file (".xrc") which may be, and is recommended to be, used by a WYSIWYG editor to edit the GUI elements of wxfred2. At the time of this writing, wxFormBuilder v3.3 - beta proved to be stable enough to create all the elements, although the generated wxFRED2_base.cpp had to be sanitized of deprecated flags in order for it to be compiled under the wxWidgets 2.9.4 lib.

"/wxfred2/editors"
- contains the source code for frames and dialogs listed under the Editors menu in wxFRED2.

"/wxfred2/help"
- contains the source code for the "About" and help dialogs listed under the Help menu in wxFRED2.

"/wxfred2/misc"
- contains the source code for miscellaneous tools listed under the Misc menu in wxFRED2.

"/wxfred2/res"
- contains the resource files used by wxFRED2 during runtime, these are typically images used for the graphic buttons.


===Importing wxFRED2.xrc into a RAD Tool===
==wxFormBuilder==
To import wxFRED2.xrc into wxFormBuilder:

 1. Open wxFormBuilder, and create a new project (File->New Project)

 2. Import wxFRED2.xrc (File->Import XRC...)

 3. In the left-hand panel labeled "Object Tree," select the project name at the very top of the tree. You most likely will need to scroll up.

 4. In the right-hand panel labeled "Object Properties," change the properties to the following:
  . Under "Project":
  . name to "wxFRED2" or your name of choice
  . path to "/"
  . embedded_files_path to "../res/"
  . code_generation to "C++, XRC" (check both boxes by expanding the group)

 5. Under "C++ Properties":
  . use_enum to "checked"
  . namespace to "fredBase"
  . event_generation to "table"
  . disconnect_events to "not checked"

  
==Other RAD Tools==
Importing into other RAD tools (or WYSIWYG editors) should be similar to importing into wxFormBuilder. Be sure the options in steps 4 and 5 are set as they are so that for your newly generated files to play nice with the existing "/wxfred2/" code.

Please be sure to NOT include the project file from the WYSIWYG editor in your commits to the fs2_open repo, as they are far larger than the .xrc and are usually specific to that editor!
